# My Homepage

Tools:<br>
    -HTML/CSS<br>
    -Bootstrap framework
<br><br>
This is my first homepage created with HTML/CSS + Bootstrap framework. For now, featuring one html file for each page instead of one single page, which I plan to change in the future.<br>
The page is divided on Home, Portfolio, About Me, Contact.
<br><br>
I don't know if I will continue with this version of Portfolio (with 'Slides'), I will probably change to something more individual so that I can put a better description, name, and a link for the project itself.
