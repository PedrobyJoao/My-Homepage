# My Homepage

Tools used:
  - HTML/CSS
  - Bootstrap framework
<br><br>
This is my first homepage created with HTML/CSS + Bootstrap framework. For now, featuring one html file for each page instead of one single page, which I plan to change in the future.<br>
The page is divided on Home, Portfolio, About Me, Contact.

>Considerations: <br>
>Mobile First> Since the majority of web users are mobile users, I'll be implementing the "Mobile First" vision, which is simply do the website checking the output in the mobile and then make the necessary changes to the desktop, and not the opposite how I did this time.<br><br>
>Portfolio> I don't know if I will continue with this version of Portfolio (with 'Slides'), I will probably change to something more individual so that I can put a better description, name, and a link for the project itself.<br><br>
>Contact me> I have to implement a database for the messages received. And add my social medias besides the footer one (just for Contact me)
